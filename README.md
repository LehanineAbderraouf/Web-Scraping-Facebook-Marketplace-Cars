# Web-Scraping-Facebook-Marketplace-Cars
I used Selenium library to scrape some items on sale on Facebook's marketplace, I tried a small sample of 72 items.

The data I scraped was for cars with prices ranging from 1000000 DA to 3000000 DA (DA is Algerian Dinars). The data I collected was Item's title, description, category,
price and location of sale. 

Importing Selenium library is necessary, aswell as downloading webdriver (chromedriver for me since I use Chrome) and then adding it to the PATH
